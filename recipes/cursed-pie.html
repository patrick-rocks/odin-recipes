    <p>A layer of ground beef and vegetables topped with fluffy mash and cursed to perfection.</p>
    <p>Equipment: Large saucepan, large pot, potato masher/ricer(preferred), colander, 8x12 baking dish, evil intent</p>
    <p><i>Serves 6-8</i></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb ground beef (sub ground lamb for a Shepherd's Pie)</li>
        <li>4 large carrots, diced</li>
        <li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 sprigs rosemary & 3 sprigs thyme, de-stemmed & finely chopped</li>
        <li>16oz chicken stock</li>
        <li>1tbsp worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>8oz frozen peas</li>
        <li>2.5lb Yukon Gold Potatoes, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>8oz heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/2 stick butter</li>
        <li>2-4oz of cheddar and/or parmesan cheese, grated</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start boiling a large pot of water for the potatoes</li>
        <li>Heat saucepan on medium high, add the beef, season with salt and pepper, breaking it down as it cooks with a sturdy spatula or spoon</li>
        <li>Once the meat is browned, remove from heat and place in a bowl, leaving behind the liquid fat</li>
        <li>Add carrots, onion, and a pinch of salt to the pan and cook on medium until the onion softens</li>
        <li>Add tomato paste and herbs and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly</li>
        <li>Add chicken stock, worcestershire sauce, and peas. Bring the mixture to a boil and then simmer on low for 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350F</li>
        <li>Boil the potatoes until they can be pierced by a fork with little effort</li>
        <li>Drain potatoes in the colander then return them to the pot and mash </li>
        <li>Add cream, butter, cheese, and a few big pinches of salt, whisk or stir the mash over the lowest heat until completely incorporated and smooth.</li>
        <li>Removed from heat. Add more cream, butter, cheese, and/or salt to taste. <em>Keep in mind cream will loosen the mash while cheese will tighten it up.</em></li>
        <li>Once the liquid in the beef mixture has significantly reduced, spoon it into the baking dish and then level it out</li>
        <li>Carefully spoon and level the mash on top of the beef without mixing the two</li>
        <li>Bake 20-30 minutes or until beef mixture bubbles up along the edges of the dish</li>
        <li>Finish under the broiler under careful supervision. Let cool for at least 20 minutes, carve a face with utensil of your choice through the top layer of mash and serve.</li>
    </ol>
